## What is Arduino?

#### History & Context

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read **inputs** - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an **output** - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do this, you use the [Arduino programming language](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage), and the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), based on [Processing](https://processing.org/). Read more about Arduino [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction). 

[Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoBUXOOdLXY) Massimo Banzi, co-founder of Arduino, explain this easy-to-use open-source microcontroller that's inspired thousands of people around the world to make the coolest things they can imagine -- from toys to satellite gear. He says, *"You don't need anyone's permission to make something great."*

Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this **open-source platform**, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.

When I talk about Arduino, I think of it in three different ways. First, Arduino is a piece of the hardware. There is a line of Arduino boards that can be used as the brains of a project. Second, Arduino is a programming language and development environment that makes working with inputs and outputs extremely accessible. Finally, Arduino is a community of engineers, artists, designers and makers of all types. The vibrant community is partly what makes Arduino so special. 

There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms, but Arduino offers several important advantages: 
+ **Inexpensive** - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than $50
Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.
+ **Simple, clear programming environment** - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.
**Open source and extensible software** - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.
**Open source and extensible hardware** - The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.
